# INTRODUCTION

# Project Overview:

# The topic of our project is to research on the relationship between gun violence and restriction policy of gun sale. 
# The purpose of our research is to answer the general question “Do more gun legislations against gun sale and using 
# actually ensure public’s safety”. We believe the question is controversial, as there are both concerns about 
# individuals’ safety and doubts about limitation on gun using among public. In our research analysis, we focused 
# on the policy of background checking, as it could reflect the general tendency of gun sale, but also explored 
# other policies and their relationship with various types of incidents and crime. 

# Audience:
  # While our report concerns general safety issue with gun restriction, which is related to every 
  # individuals’ life, we hope to focus on explaining our results to gun lovers, who could oppose the gun 
  # legislations of gun. We hope to explain the reasonability of the firearm law to them if the research result 
  # shows more laws actually lead to better social safety, or support the stand of the gun lovers by showing 
  # there is not a strong relationship between the laws and crime or gun violence.

#Data:
 
 # We used multiple data sets to facilitate our research.

#1. background checking data:
  #Comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
  #Provides data on number of firearm checks by month, state, and type

# 2. gun violence data set
# This dataset is comprised of a collection of incidents involving gun violence between January 1, 2013 
# to March 31, 2018 from http://www.gunviolencearchive.org.
# Provides data on date, location, number of deaths/injuries, congressional district, etc.

#3. Provisions data set
# Covers all 50 states from 1991 through 2017
# Includes data regarding the amount of regulations covering the sale of ammunition, such as licenses, 
# background checks, and minimum age to legally purchase ammunition. 

# Questions:
# The questions we proposed include

# How has the amount of restrictions on guns varied by state over the years?

# How does the amount of gun violence in a certain time period correlate with the amount of gun 
# regulations/restrictions in place during that time period?

# How does the amount of crime, such as robberies, during a certain time period correlate with the amount 
# of gun legislation during that same time period?

# These questions are explained by analysis on the next pages in sequence
